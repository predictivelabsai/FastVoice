"""FastVoice SDK — typed builder for voice-AI workflows.

Runtime SDK: fetches the spec catalog from the FastVoice backend at session
start and validates every `Workflow.add()` call against it. LLMs don't
need to import per-node-type classes — the `type` argument is a string
keyed against the fetched spec catalog.

    from fastvoice_sdk import FastVoiceClient, Workflow

    with FastVoiceClient(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key=...) as client:
        wf = Workflow(client=client, name="loan_qualification")
        start = wf.add(type="startCall", name="greeting", prompt="...")
        qualify = wf.add(type="agentNode", name="qualify", prompt="...")
        wf.edge(start, qualify, label="interested", condition="...")
        client.save_workflow(workflow_id=123, workflow=wf)

For typed IDE autocomplete, generate per-node dataclasses via the SDK
codegen (Phase 6) — the runtime and typed SDKs share this same core.
